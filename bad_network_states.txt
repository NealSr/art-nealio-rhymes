Bad Network States
Neal's Alldone

A couple guys in sales are online
They're always working Nine to Five,

Kinda making small talk killing time,
Browsing reddit on the company dime,

Nothin' much to speak of, internet's doin' fine.

Just a bunch of ones and zeros, and Wi-Fi 
Nerds, they all look the same,
Miles and miles of splunk logs and INFOs,
Scrolling across the monitors that glow,
Who'd want to work down there in the department from nowhere,

They've never had to reboot a server,
But the ones who patched that bug,
Pulled that plug, and drank enough coffee for you and me,
Or had to do an urgent change freeze,
They understand why we have... those bad network states,

I bet that DevOps Database System Engineer's seen it all
Just like that web developer hacking PHP on a 3-night haul
Keys are flying under their hands
Yeah that sounds like it's pretty grand

When the server throws an error
Well then you'd wish you had those IT guys
'stead of sitting around and watchin' paint dry
You'd think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why we have...
Those bad network states

Try to find that missing curly brace
Feel that frustration on your face
When you've used the wrong white space
But that feeling when you find it!
You'll understand why God made
Why you'd never trade your grade
For those bad network states


Have you ever had to reboot a server?
When the server throws an error,
