Christmas Merchandise
From the Dangerous Lines Soundtrack
By Nealio

 

As I drive to the Mall where I spend all my Green
I Look around for a space but realize it can't be seen
Cause I've been driving in circles so long that
Even my Gas Tank thinks that my Fuel is gone

But I ain't never passed a space I couldn't fit in
People drivin' SUVs you know they gon' be wishin'
To see a space that's open â€“ Looks mighty fine
But some redneck 4 by 4 done parked over the line.

I park there anyway, cause my car is small
And it serves him right for drivin' his tank to the mall.
When he gets back at 4 he won't fit in between the door
He'll have to Climb through the TRUNK in his Chevy Piece o' Junk

Been Drivin' round all night just to park for Christmas merchandise
I burned out one headlight drivin' round for Christmas Merchandise
Fender bender happened twice drivin round for Christmas Merchandise
Keep spendin' most my life goin' out for Christmas Merchandise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't wait in no more lines, I'll get parking meter fines
So I gotta go Download the Internet
Overnight FedEx by Amazon's a safer bet

I'm an educated nerd with a paypal account
Got an email address and a trackball to mount
Get the wish list registry in my shopping cart
Checkbox Gift Wrap and Tags, it is really an art, Fool

All that's left now is to pay for the bill
My check account's overdrawn and I start to feel ill.
There's money there now but will there be on the twenty-fourth
The way things is goin' I don't know.

Tell my Why Do We Have to Spend Money
When the Best Presents are the Ones that are Free?
 
Been spending most the night on the web for Christmas Merchandise
Credit Limit's Way too high rackin' up that Christmas Merchandise
Been spendin' most my life shopping round for Christmas Merchandise
Bought a few things for my Wife when I shopped for Christmas Merchandise

Best Buy's Got the Money, Wal-Mart Gots the Power
Dollar General's Cheaper, Walgreens just has Flowers
Everybody's running, and half of them ain't lookin'
It's no wonders there's car wrecks
And a fight for the roasted chicken.

They say the thought's what counts but looks like nobody's thinkin
The Christmas Lights I see are the Ambulance Lights Blinkin'

It's all a mess
Almost a Joke
I guess that's Life
That's why I don't go shopping when I'm Broke, Fool

Almost got in a fight pickin' up some Christmas Merchandise
Think I'm Losing my Mind dealin' with the Christmas Merchandise
Candy Canes will be Half-Price the day After Christmas Merchandise
Got a Headache, Need some Ice after all this Christmas Merchandise

Tell me why do we have to Spend Money
When the Best Presents Are the Ones that are Free?

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
