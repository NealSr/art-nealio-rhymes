Drinking my Dinner
  Neal Richardson Sr
  13 April 2023

Went to my favorite restaurant
And the waitlist was an hour
Yeah even though I called ahead
I had extra time to shower

Drivin round for a place to park
So I had some time to think
And the longer that I waited there
All I wanted was a drink

But when I saw the drink menu
and tried to quench my thirst
There were a million different options
Which one do I pick first?

(CHORUS)
want it blended or on rocks
do I want an extra shot?
of tequila so you feel a
little buzz when you are done?

there's so many different kinds
that I think I'll lose my mind
guess i better try them all
yeah I'll really have a ball

cause it's five o'clock somewhere
and I really couldn't care
it's a lemon-lime tequila "si bonita" freakin' Margarita

I took a gulp out of that big mug
And it hit me like a tranquilizer
So I ordered up a juicy steak
and a little appetizer

My wife didn't mind a bit
When I really started gettin friendly
And I asked if I could have one more?
Cause it's friday I'm a little spendy

So I gave her the keys to the car
Cause I wanted to have a little fun
And she didn't even mind a bit
Yeah she's really my number one

(CHORUS)

By now I've eaten all the bread
And my favorite snack the cheddar bites
Yeah I was gettin pretty sure
It was gonna be one of those nights

And I thought they'd cut me off
By the time I had my third refill
But they brought my drink right out
And then I thought about the bill

I guess it's understandable
If the drinks made up half the check
Guess it's going on the credit card
And you can guess what I did next

Got one more drink on the rocks
And I got that extra shot
of tequila yeah I felt a
big old buzz when I got done

When I wake up the next day
Probably really gonna pay
Cause you know I tried them all
And I really had a ball

It was five o'clock right here
and I didn't want a beer
I wanted lemon-lime tequila "si bonita" Margarita
(repeat & slow down)
