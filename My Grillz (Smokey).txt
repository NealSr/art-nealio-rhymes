My Grillz (Smokey)
NealY

Run that hardware store and tell 'em make me a grill
  - Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Got the whole top propane and the bottom row's coals
  - Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
  - Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
  - Y'all know what this is, So So Def
Got thirty pattys on bottom, thirty more at the top
  - Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top
I could out-grill McDonalds and make 'em move six blocks
  - All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
And if you want you a drink, I got some beer in a box
  - If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If you ask me for the price, it was on sale by a lot
  - If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got an infrared-heat burner, traditional burner
  - I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I've even got that side-ways cook up some beans burner
  - I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I could go grill out back, see (oh) or the front, see (oh)
  - I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
I got a portable G (oh) for when I'm Drive-EEng
  - Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
Whenever I'm smokin' you can tell I ain't jokin'
  - VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see the neighborhood kids and my grandmama chokin'
  - You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I
  - Cause when I
  - Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
  - Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')
  - I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
  - It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
  - I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
  - So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
  - Just say

  - I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
  - I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
  - My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
  - Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
  - I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
  - Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
  - My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
  - The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
