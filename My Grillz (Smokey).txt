My Grillz (Smokey)
NealY

Run that hardware store and tell 'em make me a grill
Got the whole top propane and the bottom row's coals
  - Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
  - Y'all know what this is, So So Def
Got thirty pattys on bottom, thirty more at the top
I could out-grill McDonalds and make 'em move six blocks
And if you want you a drink, I got some beer in a box
If you ask me for the price, it was on sale by a lot
I got an infrared-heat burner, traditional burner
I've even got that side-ways cook up some beans burner
I could go grill out back, see (oh) or the front, see (oh)
I got a portable G (oh) for when I'm Drive-EEng
Whenever I'm smokin' you can tell I ain't jokin'
You see the neighborhood kids and my grandmama chokin'
Cause when I
Open up that grill, and it's steamin' (say what)
Burger Patties, extra cheezin' (cheezin')
I got a grill that's a George Foreman, you know what that means?
It's just a LEAN, MEAN, FAT-REDUCIN' GRILLIN' MACHINE
I'm grillin' up dishes in Spring, Summer, Winter, or Fall
So if you need something fired-up, just give me a call
And say
-- (Chorus) --
Fire up that beef
(How you like it cooked)?
I like it medium-well
(You like it medium-WHAT)?
Medium-Well - Me-DE-Um WELL
Run to that hardware store and tell 'em make me a grill
Fire up that beef
(How you like it cooked)?
I like it medium-well
(You like it medium-WHAT)?
Medium-Well - Me-DE-Um WELL
Got that whole top Propane and the bottom row's coals

It's time to cook baby
I'm the wing man Spicy White
I got my backyard glowing with Tiki-Torches Every Night
I got some lawnchairs and some beer pong on the grass
If we see a cold front, got that heater hooked on natural gas

My veggies steamin' wrapped up in aluminum foil
And you ain't lived until you came down for a crawfish boil
I put my order in on Tuesday at the butcher shop
Twenty brats a few pork chops and ribeye for the city cops

My motivation is to simply be the very best
The trophies from the festivals simply symbolize success
I got accessories and some kitchen gadgets to make you stare
But it's my apron any my oven mits that keep you here
I'm pyrotechnic certified for the 4th of July
Just bring a side dish and watch me light up the sky
My shows are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Grab some sunscreen cause it's sunny when I light the grills
(Chorus)

Heyo, got them bratwurst, got them burgers, got them dogs
Hunger's gon' hit and make you cravin' for them all
I can cook anything you give me though
My grills got space for everything to go
Look what it do, on the tube
QVC, Daily Deal
Where they do a happy dance
Every time they try my meals
When I'm grillin' like a villian
All my buddies sit there chillin'
Gotta keep it slow and low and keep the baked beans from spillin'
I ain't dissing nobody but lets set the record straight
KC was the first to make that Barbeque great
You can keep your Carolina and your Tennesee Wings
Cause when they try my smokie ribs you know the fat lady sings
I got four different sizes of the big green egg
MiniMax in my truck right next to the keg
When the tailgating starts it's a sight to behold
Cause the whole top's propane and the bottom row's coals
(Chorus)
  - Boy, how you get grill that way
  - And how much did you pay
  - Every time I see you
  - Tha first thing I'm gon' say hey
(Chorus)
