"Cleanin Out My Facebook"

Where's my wall, I have no wall in my profile, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been blocked or defriended before?
I have, i've been poked and relation-Ended before,
Gettin' Roast for my Crazy Post, look at them boast,
Say something bad and you'll never take it back- its a ghost,
all this farm-villin' and chillin' wastin' time I could be fillin
losin' brain cells from the Cathode-Ray Tube my eyes killin'
Keep addin' friends, at a whim, people I don't even KNOW!
Until they post on my wall and I just WISH THEY WOULD GO
Offendin' people I care about, gettin' in trouble at work,
Stuff other people write makes me look like a jerk!
But not for much longer, 'cause I'm getting much Stronger!
C-Ya Facebook, i'ma make you disappear now!

[CHORUS]
I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my profile
(one more time),
I said I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, I'm cleanin out my profile...

I got some haters in my profile
and I don't know just how they got there,
so before I cancel the account and let it all out, I'ma gonna shout.
I'll take you back to 1999
before I ever had two-hundred fifty, friends for a dime.
I was a junior in high-school, just a kid with a mouse
When you wanted to get on the internet, you actually left out the house
Or you waited, Because your older siblings were lining up some-one to go date-in'
I look at cell-phones today and couldn't miss-it for long
You can tell because I'm using it to write-up my song.
You wanna order a pizza or watch a movie online,
Just pull out your android or iPhone and its on in no time.
But what we've traded is silly, no doubt its a loss
You can't say anything online without it reaching your boss.
You ever Wonder, why you can search for a pail,
And in two weeks or less, you get bombarded
By advertisements in your email

I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my profile
(one more time),
I said I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, I'm cleanin out my profile...

Now I would never diss on my Facebook just to get paid
Take a second and recognize where the money is made
When you say something good or bad online
Just try to remember Everytime
Your boss and your family just might be watchin'
Wonderin' why you gotta be hatin' on your friends in your profile,
Goin' off on your family
like you were just playin'
My whole life I was told to hold my tongue when I thought not
'til I am older and bolder and this yellin' I'll Bought-Not
Wouldn't it, couldn't be better if you said good stuff online,
Took time to be positive instead of claimin' Victims of Crimes?!
But guess what, you've got your own profile and baggage,
and I can't stick around to hear out all your haggage!
There's beauty around you just look out, its awesomeness
I hope you do, I hope someday you'll get over this
See, what hurts me the most is you were happy when we friended,
So post your cries, yell out loud, cause our friendship is ended.
Perhaps someday maybe your hurt will run away with your hate,
And then your friends will laugh and smile when you walk in through that gate.
But til that day and as long as you scream,
Your posts are gone, nothin' more than a dream

I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, i'm cleanin' out my profile
(one more time),
I said I'm sorry facebook,
I never meant to hurt you,
I never meant to make you cry,
but tonight, I'm cleanin out my profile...
