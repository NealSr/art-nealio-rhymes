Three weeks ago
I thought I'd like to work from home
With conference calls in a bathrobe
But I've lost all hope

Working remote
I think of all the emails I've wrote
But when I check-up on my slack
Nobody wrote back

All by myself
Don't want to work all by myself not no more
Alone at home
Don't want to work alone at home anymore

Hard to sit still
Sometimes I wonder if I'm ill
And so I get down on my knees
And pray it's alergies

COVID-19
Why you gotta be - so gosh-darn mean? What's it for?
Leave us alone,
So we can leave, our lonely home, just once more.

When this is done
I won't get mad at anyone
And might give hugs out just for fun
I might even run

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
