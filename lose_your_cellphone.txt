Lose Your Cellphone
Eminem
Look, if you had one charger, or one USB Cable
To charge every single cellphone in your house
For the whole weekend
Would you loan it out? or just say tough shit?

Yo
His bar's on empty, he's freakin', gotta get ready
The bluetooth and WiFi are turned off already, almost dead, he
He panics, but on his Facebook he keeps postin' heavy
To save face, can't let them know he's forgettin'

Left his charger behind, he hopes that somewhere he can find
A starbucks or gas station that doesn't mind
He's driving round, but his phone's shutting down
The battery's dead, black screen, LED - RED!

His back pack's a catastrophy, oh there's someold RAP CD
Oh look, there's a charger, no cord
Just my luck, what is wrong with me, lord

He can't find it, he knows his best friend has one of those
But no matter
He owes his friend dough, but he's broke
He's so screwed but he knows
If he doesn't charge up his phone, that's when it's
Pencil and pad again, yo, "Ye Olde Analogue"
He better plug in before the weekend begins

You better charge your cell phone, it's well known, don't leave home
You don't know if there's gonna be charger when you're there
You only get one shot, so make sure you plan and prepare
And don't you ever forget to charge, or at least bring a (spare)
(repeat)


His phone is missing, coulda sworn it was ringing
Searched the house, he's not faking
Make it RING, as he dials the number, feeling dumber
He hopes the ringtone's loud
but it's on vibrate, no such luck for him

The buzzer goes quiet, he's about to riot
He knows he can't find it he's got to go buy it
Another two year contract, his budget's on a diet
Payday Loans, God only knows
He's no closer to tracking it down, its gone forever
Reminds him of that time he got stuck in rainy weather
He was holdin' it close, but it fell in some colder water
The phone won't turn on no mo, its a doorstop
A bucket of rice wouldn't help, he tried twice
Checked eBay for a price - it's worth nada
So this whole story repeats and he's two for two
Sucks to be you, partna, but be careful next time
Or you'll get your own rhyme

Cause when you lose your cellphone, or break-it, you bought-it
So watch-it, and better never let it go
It only takes one drop, do not let it hit the ground
Or leave it out of your sight, or it might never be found
(repeat)


So don't be dumb, I know it might not sound fun
If your motherfukin' charger's gone get another one
I used to let my friends and family borrow mine
They'd come back bent up or stripped out, and act like it's fine
So I kept chargin' and kept plugin' my phone all day
Best believe I've got four bars when I go play

All the times that MY battery died just be-
cause of MY failed attempts to TRY or to
plan ahead and provide the right type of
adapter for my cellphone
'Cause man, these God Damn USB cords, don't fit iPhones
And there's no standard, there's no one size fits all. Just ask my wife
And these plugs are so small and they're getting even smaller
Tryin' to fit it in an open socket, plus
Not unplug the other gear
all my fault cause I failed to plan ahead and

 
All the pain insIDE amplified by the 
fact That I can't get by with my nine to 
five And I can't provide the right type of 
life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me 
to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got


(chorus)
