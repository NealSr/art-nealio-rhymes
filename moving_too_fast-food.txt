Moving too Fast-Food
  by Neal Richardson Sr - ~1999

I grew up without Dairy Queen
and delivery pizza was hardly ever seen.
So the first time I ate
at McDonald's for the prom,
I knew one cheezy burger
would never ere go wrong.

For me, back in the past,
when it would come to food,
I'd eat up the leftovers,
or be considered "rude"
But after that fine feast
in the cool flourescent light,
I could order fast food
everyday and every night.

It doesn't really matter
what time I eat my meal
For here or to go,
those memories I feel
Of a twenty-dollar tux
but a million dollar girl,
It makes me want some ice-cream
Vanilla Chocolate Swirl.

So as I close this sonnet,
which might not be shakespeare,
I leave you with one message.
To me it's very clear.
From the first time that I saw you,
it came as no surprise.
We go together,
like a happy meal with fries.
